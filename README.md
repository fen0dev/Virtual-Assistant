# Virtual Assistant Project

This project is a sophisticated virtual assistant built with Python. It leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech, and machine learning to provide a personalized and interactive user experience.
Features:

    Speech Recognition:
        Listens to user commands and recognizes speech using Google Speech Recognition API.

    Text-to-Speech:
        Responds to user commands with natural-sounding speech.

    Dynamic Activity Suggestions:
        Suggests activities based on user preferences, mood, weather, and time of day.
        Uses a machine learning model trained on user data to improve suggestions over time.

    Music Playback:
        Plays music by checking subscriptions to Apple Music and Spotify, or by playing from YouTube if no subscription is found.

    Food and Beverage Recommendations:
        Suggests meals and beverages based on the time of day and user preferences.
        Provides complete recipes for suggested meals.

Setup and Installation

    Clone the repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-assistant.git
cd virtual-assistant

Create a virtual environment:

sh

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

sh

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Set up API keys:
        Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY in main.py.
        Set up Spotify and Apple Music credentials if required.

Running the Assistant
